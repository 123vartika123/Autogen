This script simulates Userproxy and Assistant agent interactions using GPT-2 from Hugging Face. It demonstrates group chats, external function calls, and retrieval-augmented generation for QA and code tasks. It includes a Data Science conversation, logging interactions, and saving chat histories to files, without directly using Microsoft AutoGen.
